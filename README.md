`Hello there!` <br>I'm **Rand0x** and I'm into cybersecurity. Ever since I was a kid, I managed to bypass firewalls to play online games, but back then, I was more focused on gaming than on learning and hacking.<br>
Right now, I'm focusing on **web hacking** to do **bug bounty hunting** and hopefully work as a freelancer in the future. Before getting into cybersecurity, I trained as an electrician on construction sites and then completed a program to become a technician in electrical engineering. As a technician, I got into software development in C/C++, microcontroller programming, and the Qt framework. Eventually, I found my passion and studied **computer science** with a main focus on cybersecurity. Right now, I'm working as a penetration tester in the field of web hacking.
